## Hazelcast Coding Challenge

Imagine an environment that consists of multiple nodes. Each node is a separate JVM process and could potentially be running on a distinct physical machine. Your task is to write an application that will run on all nodes. The application should coordinate between the nodes so that as they are started `System.out.println("We are started!")` is only called **exactly once** across the whole cluster, whether 1 node or 10 are running. 

As we are discussing a distributed environment, your solution should take into consideration the variables that such an environment presents, such as:
Some nodes may start at the exact same time as others.
Some nodes may start seconds or minutes later than others.
Some nodes may restart before others start a first time.
Some nodes may never be started at all.

There is no need to build a distributed system from scratch. You can use an existing library for the solution. We highly value simplicity.

Good luck!
